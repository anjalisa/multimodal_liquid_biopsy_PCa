This repository contains the analysis scripts used in the study: 
**"Multimodal plasma and urinary cell-free DNA profiling improves risk stratification in newly diagnosed prostate cancer"**

The custom analysis scripts were developed for the genomic and epigenomic analyses of plasma and urinary cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from prostate cancer patients and cancer-free controls:

**Genomic analyses:**
- Copy number variation (CNV) analysis
- Chromosomal instability analysis (CIA)

**Epigenomic analyses:**
- cfDNA fragmentation analysis
- Methylation profiling

Established computational algorithms and previously published tools were adapted and extended for study-specific purposes. 
The provided scripts cover data preprocessing, quality control, statistical analysis, and visualization relevant to each analysis type.
